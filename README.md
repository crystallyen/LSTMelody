# 📄 LSTMelody

## 💻 Introduction

**LSTMelody** is a deep learning project that generates multi-instrument MIDI songs, including drums, bass, chords, and lead instruments. It has a custom LSTM architecture trained on a subset of the Lakh MIDI dataset and an efficient and scalable data pipeline for structured input. It consists of a user-friendly interface built with React, and a FastAPI backend to perform model inference.
